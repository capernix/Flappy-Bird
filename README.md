# Project No.1: Creating Flappy Bird using Java
## Abstract
I was fascinated by game development from a long time, but I never committed to learning it in detail, but after a good amount of experience in 
writing code in Java, I dwelt on learning more on my own. I wanted to apply my existing knowledge and learn something new as well, and I wanted 
a great first project that wasn't too tough on me but something I'd love making. After some research I found this great YouTube tutorial that I
felt I could follow and started making flappy bird :) It used Java and its APIs of Swing and AWT which felt like a decent entryway to my GUI journey.

I put in a day of work understanding everything and finished up with the project which was super fun. Uploading something for the first time on GitHub as 
well which ticks a lot of checkboxes for me. Onto the next now :)

## What I used
Java, Swing, AWT

## Time Taken and Difficulty
1 day, and like a 4/10.

Peace.
